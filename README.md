# zettelkasten-steward

This is a small system I'm writing to try and create a basic zettelkasten system using just org-mode notes and Emacs Lisp. I find the other note taking apps to be either too complicated to set up or requiring too much manual work to do the things I'd like them to do.

A few things I'm looking to add:

- [x] Automatic ID generation
- [] Automatic tag indexing
- [] org-capture-templates
   - [x] permanent notes
   - [] fleeting notes
   - [] literature notes
